# Load Preferences — Pull Standing Shopping Preferences from Memory

Load the user's standing shopping preferences (country, currency, trusted/avoided brands, markup threshold, risk tolerance, preferred vendors, etc.) into the current session so they can be applied during `/intake`, `/research`, and `/recommend`.

## What "standing preferences" means

Things that apply to **every** purchase the user makes — not to this specific one:

- **Geographic context**: country, currency, VAT rate, VAT status (consumer / business-reclaimable / exempt)
- **Brand attitudes**: permanently trusted manufacturers, permanently avoided manufacturers
- **Vendor attitudes**: preferred marketplaces/retailers, avoided ones, international shipping tolerance
- **Thresholds**: default markup ceiling (% over international RRP), review score floor, risk tolerance
- **Delivery**: email for PDF report

These are stored in **memory** (via Mem0 MCP, recommended), not in any per-purchase repo. One update, all future purchases benefit.

## Preferred storage: Mem0 MCP

The recommended persistence layer is [Mem0](https://mem0.ai), exposed as an MCP server. If the Mem0 MCP is configured:

1. Query memories tagged `shopping_preferences` (or scoped to the `shopping_preferences` namespace)
2. Parse into the fields listed above
3. Write the snapshot into the **"Standing preferences snapshot"** section of `spec.md`
4. Report to the user what was loaded: "Loaded preferences from Mem0 — country: X, markup threshold: Y%, etc."

### Typical Mem0 MCP tool calls

Depending on which Mem0 MCP server is installed, the tool names vary. Common ones:

- `mcp__mem0__search_memory` — query with `"shopping preferences"` or similar
- `mcp__mem0__list_memories` — filter by tag / category
- `mcp__mem0__get_memory` — by ID

Use whichever read tool the installed Mem0 server exposes.

## Fallback 1: local file

If Mem0 MCP is not available, check `~/.claude/shopping-preferences.md`. If present, read it and populate the snapshot section of `spec.md` from it.

Tell the user: "Mem0 MCP not detected. Loaded preferences from `~/.claude/shopping-preferences.md` instead. Install Mem0 MCP for cross-device persistence."

## Fallback 2: prompt the user

If neither source is available:

1. Tell the user: "No standing preferences found. You can either (a) run `/save-preferences` to set them up now (recommended — one-time setup, benefits every future purchase), or (b) skip and I'll ask you per-purchase questions each time."
2. If the user chooses (a): delegate to `/save-preferences`.
3. If the user chooses (b): proceed — `/intake` will prompt for the standing-preference fields in-line.

## After loading

1. Write the loaded values into `spec.md` → **Standing preferences snapshot** section
2. Report a 3–5 line summary: "Loaded preferences — Country: X, Currency: Y, Markup threshold: Z%. Full snapshot in spec.md. Run `/intake` next."

## What NOT to do

- **Do not write per-purchase information here.** Must-haves, hard nos for this purchase, budget for this purchase, timeline — those belong in `spec.md` via `/intake`.
- **Do not update Mem0 from this command.** `/load-preferences` is read-only. Writes go through `/save-preferences`.
