# Claude Purchasing Assistant

## Purpose

This workspace runs **one purchase decision** from spec to PDF report. One repo = one purchase. When the user is shopping for a new thing (car, laptop, chair, drill…), they spin up a fresh copy of this template and use it end-to-end.

## Two-tier preferences model (+ optional buyer-profile bias)

**Standing preferences** live in **memory** (via Mem0 MCP — recommended). Per-purchase details live in **`spec.md`** at the repo root. This separation is deliberate: the things that *always* apply to the user (their country, trusted brands, markup ceiling) don't belong in each new repo — they belong in memory, loaded fresh into every new purchase workspace.

- **Memory (Mem0)** — country, currency, VAT status, trusted brands, avoided brands, preferred vendors, avoided vendors, markup threshold, review score floor, risk tolerance, international shipping tolerance, email for PDF
- **`spec.md` (this repo)** — what's being bought, must-haves, hard nos, nice-to-haves, budget, timeline, this-purchase priorities, this-purchase overrides to standing prefs, context/history
- **`buyer-profiles/` (optional)** — named purchasing archetypes (BIFL, budget, minimalist, etc.) that the user can apply to this purchase via `/apply-profile`. Works as a fallback for users without Mem0, or as a shortcut for users who want to reframe a purchase quickly. Profile content is additive over standing prefs and `spec.md` — must-haves and hard nos always win.

## The workflow

```
/load-preferences   → pull standing prefs from Mem0 memory
/save-preferences   → (one-time or when updating) persist standing prefs to memory
/intake             → build spec.md (per-purchase only; skips standing fields)
/research           → evaluate candidates against spec + standing prefs
/recommend          → generate PDF report
```

Four phases in order: **intake → spec → research → report.** Preference management is a sidecar workflow, not a phase.

## Mem0 MCP integration

The recommended memory backend is [Mem0](https://mem0.ai) exposed as an MCP server. With Mem0:

- Preferences persist across repos, machines, sessions
- Update once (via `/save-preferences`), applied to all future purchases automatically
- Each new template instance `/load-preferences` → snapshot copied into `spec.md` for audit

If Mem0 MCP isn't available, the commands fall back to:

1. A local file: `<plugin-data-dir>/shopping-preferences.md` — resolved via `$CLAUDE_USER_DATA/purchasing/` (see the `meta-tools:plugin-data-storage` canonical skill)
2. Inline prompting during `/intake` (last resort — user will be re-asked each time)

The templates degrade gracefully. Mem0 is the "power user" path.

No `purchases/active|completed/` nesting. No per-repo `buyer-profile.md`. The repo *is* the purchase.

## The spec file (`spec.md`)

`spec.md` contains only per-purchase details:

- **What I'm buying** — category + primary use case
- **Must-haves** — hard positive requirements
- **Hard nos / Dealbreakers** — disqualifying characteristics (distinct from must-haves; adds to the standing avoided-brands list from memory)
- **Nice-to-haves** — tie-breakers
- **Budget** — target + ceiling + flexibility
- **Timeline** — urgency + deal-hunting posture
- **Priorities (this purchase)** — ranked factors for this decision
- **Per-purchase overrides to standing preferences** — e.g. accept higher markup for a niche item this time
- **Context / history** — replacing what, past experience, compatibility constraints
- **Standing preferences snapshot** — read-only audit of what `/load-preferences` pulled in

**Must-haves vs Hard nos are distinct categories.** Must-haves are positive requirements the product must satisfy. Hard nos are disqualifying characteristics the product must *not* have. Both trigger automatic disqualification, but they're captured separately because they represent different kinds of constraints.

## Workflow phases

### Phase 0: Preferences (once per user/machine)

- Run `/save-preferences` the first time the user uses any purchasing template.
- Re-run to update when standing preferences change.

### Phase 1: Load + Intake — `/load-preferences` then `/intake`

`/intake` should call `/load-preferences` automatically as step 0. Combined behaviour:

1. Load standing preferences from Mem0 (or fallback file)
2. Snapshot them into the "Standing preferences snapshot" section of `spec.md`
3. Ask only the per-purchase questions — **never re-ask standing fields**
4. Explicitly capture **must-haves** and **hard nos / dealbreakers** as distinct sections
5. Save to `spec.md`; set Status to "Configured"

### Phase 2: Research — `/research`

1. Read `spec.md` + the standing preferences snapshot + the **Buyer profile** section (if populated)
2. Apply the profile's weight adjustments on top of the default evaluation weights; include the profile's preferred-signals and red-flags alongside spec-level must-haves and hard nos
3. Process any sources in `for-ai/` (run `/extract` first if screenshots/PDFs)
4. If the spec allows expanded search or no sources were provided, discover candidates via web research
5. For each candidate, evaluate:
   - **Must-haves satisfied?** — if not, disqualify
   - **Hard nos triggered?** — if yes, disqualify (both per-purchase hard nos from spec AND standing avoided brands from prefs)
   - **Manufacturer reputation** — reliability, support, warranty
   - **Build quality + reviews** — aggregated across multiple sources
   - **Value** — local price vs international RRP, markup %
   - **Foundational disqualifications** — safety hazards, sub-2.5/5 ratings, counterfeit-prone items, defunct vendors (these apply even if not in the spec)
6. Apply the **per-purchase overrides** from `spec.md` before applying standing thresholds (e.g. if spec overrides markup to 60%, use that instead of the standing 30%)
7. Mark each candidate **CONSIDER** or **DISQUALIFIED** with reason
8. Write `from-ai/research.md`

### Phase 3: Recommend — `/recommend`

1. Read `spec.md` + `from-ai/research.md`
2. Rank CONSIDER candidates using the spec's priority order; apply the **Buyer profile** priorities as tie-breakers if the section is populated; fall back to standing priorities from memory if neither has any
3. Pick #1 (recommended), #2 (runner-up), #3 (budget alternative, if one makes sense)
4. Generate `from-ai/report.typ` and compile to `from-ai/report.pdf`
5. If Resend MCP is available and email is in standing prefs → send PDF
6. Report location + top pick

## Agent guidelines

### Before any research

1. Verify `spec.md` status is "Configured" — if not, run `/intake` first
2. Verify the standing preferences snapshot is populated — if not, run `/load-preferences`
3. Make sure **must-haves** AND **hard nos** are both populated — don't start research with an incomplete spec
4. Check `for-ai/` for user-provided sources

### Foundational disqualification (always applied)

Regardless of spec, automatically disqualify or strongly flag:

- **Manufacturer red flags** — documented fraud, safety recalls, defunct/unreachable companies, regulatory bans
- **Product red flags** — safety hazards, aggregate rating <2.5/5, widespread defect patterns, counterfeit-prone items where authenticity can't be verified
- **Vendor red flags** — grey-market sellers with no authorization, no return policy on high-value items, fraud reports

Plus standing avoided brands from memory (unless the spec's per-purchase overrides relax them).

Deprioritise (don't auto-disqualify) if:

- Rating between standing review floor (default 3.5/5) and 2.5/5 — flag for explicit acknowledgment
- Manufacturer with mixed reputation — include warning
- Limited warranty / international-only support
- New or unproven products (<6 months on market, <50 reviews)

### Sub-agent context passing

When spawning sub-agents (manufacturer-research, product-extraction, price-comparison, review-aggregation, currency-conversion), always pass:

- Geography + currency (from standing prefs snapshot)
- Must-haves + hard nos (from spec)
- Standing avoided brands (from prefs)
- Effective markup threshold (spec override if present, else standing default)
- Risk tolerance (spec override if present, else standing default)
- **Applied buyer profile** (if any) — so sub-agents know which evaluation axes to uplift and what profile-specific signals / red flags to surface
- Specific product/brand being researched

## Product data caching

Cache fetched product data in `data/products/[brand]-[model-slug].json`:

```json
{
  "brand": "Sony",
  "model": "WH-1000XM5",
  "category": "headphones",
  "fetched": "2026-04-16",
  "specs": {...},
  "pricing": [
    {"vendor": "Amazon", "price": 349.99, "currency": "USD", "url": "...", "checked": "2026-04-16"}
  ],
  "reviews": {...}
}
```

Cache behaviour: check before fetching; if <7 days old reuse; always refresh pricing.

## Slash commands

Core flow:

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/load-preferences` | Pull standing shopping prefs from Mem0 memory (or fallback file) |
| `/save-preferences` | Persist standing prefs to Mem0 — one-time or when updating |
| `/intake` | Populate `spec.md` — per-purchase only (must-haves + hard nos distinctly) |
| `/apply-profile [profile(s)]` | Bias this purchase toward a named buyer archetype (BIFL, budget, minimalist, etc.). Single or combined (e.g. `bifl+power-user`). Optional. |
| `/research` | Evaluate candidates against the spec + standing prefs + profile (if applied) |
| `/recommend` | Generate the final PDF recommendation report |
| `/compare` | Side-by-side comparison of specific products |
| `/extract` | Extract products from screenshots/catalogs to CSV |

Iterative / quick checks (usable anytime after `/intake`):

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/evaluate <product>` | Quick inline check of a single product against the current spec + latest recommendation |
| `/market-check [models]` | Compare local prices vs international RRP with import-cost realism — writes `from-ai/research/market-check-YYYY-MM-DD.md` |
| `/recompare` | Re-run the shortlist against the current spec; writes a new dated `from-ai/recommendations/recommendations-YYYY-MM-DD.md` without overwriting history |
| `/update-spec <change>` | Targeted edit to `spec.md` (addition / edit / removal) — diff-only response, flags downstream impact |

## Sub-agent architecture

Sub-agents live in `.claude/agents/` and are invoked by the main agent as needed.

| Agent | Purpose | When to use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `manufacturer-research` | Reputation, history, support quality, regional presence | Before recommending an unfamiliar brand |
| `product-extraction` | Extract products from screenshots / PDFs into structured CSV | When user drops images in `for-ai/` |
| `price-comparison` | Compare prices across vendors + import-cost realism | When evaluating value across multiple sources or buy-local vs import |
| `review-aggregation` | Synthesise reviews across platforms into a weighted score | During `/research` for each serious candidate |
| `spec-verification` | Confirm/refute a load-bearing spec claim against authoritative sources | When a must-have depends on a specific spec that retailers often misstate |

All sub-agents must: read `spec.md` + standing preferences snapshot first; apply disqualification criteria (spec + standing); document sources (URLs, dates); return structured data; flag uncertainties rather than guess.

## Dated outputs (history preserved)

For iterative purchases, outputs are dated and never overwritten:

- `from-ai/research/[topic]-YYYY-MM-DD.md` — topical research notes (e.g. `brand-reputation-X-2026-04-16.md`, `market-check-2026-04-16.md`). Maintain `from-ai/research/index.md` as a pointer list.
- `from-ai/recommendations/recommendations-YYYY-MM-DD.md` — written by `/recommend` and `/recompare`. Each run writes a new dated file with a "Changes vs. previous" section.
- `from-ai/reports/report-YYYY-MM-DD.{typ,pdf,md}` — PDF outputs. Source (`.typ`), artifact (`.pdf`), and markdown twin (`.md`) colocated.

Simple single-shot outputs (e.g. `from-ai/research.md` written by `/research`, `from-ai/compare.md` written by `/compare`) live at the top level of `from-ai/` and are rewritten each run.

## Success criteria

A recommendation succeeds when:

1. **Single PDF deliverable** — one professional report
2. **Decisive** — clear #1 pick with runner-ups
3. **Must-haves explicitly checked** — adherence matrix shows each
4. **Hard nos explicitly checked** — clearance matrix shows each (per-purchase + standing)
5. **Preferences traced** — reasoning references both the spec and the standing preferences snapshot
6. **Foundational rules applied** — no disqualified products recommended
7. **Data cached** — product specs saved for potential re-runs
8. **Report delivered** — PDF emailed if Resend MCP is configured
